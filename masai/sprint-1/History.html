            <p><b>Where</b> did hockey originate? <b>Who</b> set down the first rules of the modern game? <b>What</b>
                was the FIH set up to
                do?</p>
            <h3>Hockey and it's Origins</h3>
            <img src="resources/ancient.jpeg" alt="ancient_rock.jpg">
            <p>>The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game
                was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game
                was also played in Iran in around 2,000BC.<br>
                >Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as
                by
                the Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World.<br>
                >The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the
                growth of public schools, such as Eton.<br>
                >The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules.
                The
                original association survived for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding member
                clubs.

            <h3>Hockey and the Olympics</h3>
            <img style="float: right" src="resources/old2.jpeg" alt="ice_hockey.jpeg" width="65%" height="350px">
            <p>>The inaugural Olympic Hockey Competition for men was held in London in 1908 with England, Ireland,
                Scotland and Wales competing separately. With the addition of Germany and France, the competition ran
                with six teams.<br>
                >After having made its first appearance at the London Games, hockey was subsequently dropped from the
                1912 Stockholm Games after host nations were granted control over ‘optional sports’. It reappeared in
                1920 in Antwerp after pressure from Belgian hockey advocates before being omitted again in Paris in
                1924.<br>
                >The formation of the International Hockey Federation in 1924 was not soon enough for the Paris Olympics
                but it did grant hockey re-entry in Amsterdam in 1928. Hockey has been on the programme ever since, with
                women's hockey included for the first time in Moscow in 1980.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Hockey and the FIH</h3>
            <p>>Motivated by hockey’s omission from the 1924 Paris Games, the Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur
                Gazon (FIH) was founded by Paul Léautey. M. Léautey, who would later become the first president of the
                FIH, called together seven National Federations to form the sport’s international governing body.<br>
                >These founding members, which represented both men's and women's hockey in their countries, were
                Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Spain and Switzerland.<br>
                >Popularised in the late 19th century, the women’s game developed quickly in many countries. In 1927, the
                International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations (IFWHA) was formed. After celebrating their
                respective Golden Jubilees - the FIH in 1974 and the IFWHA in 1980 - the two organisations came together
                in 1982 to form the current FIH.<br>
                >By 1964, there were already 50 countries affiliated with the FIH, as well as three Continental
                Associations - Africa, Pan America and Asia - and in 1974, there were 71 members. Today, the
                International Hockey Federation consists of five Continental Associations, 137 National Associations and
                is still growing.</p>
